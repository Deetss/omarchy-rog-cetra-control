# Development notes

## External action approval

- Local development and hardware testing do not authorize publication. Prepare
  changes and submission drafts locally; obtain explicit confirmation of the
  specific action, destination and version before pushing, publishing a release,
  or creating/editing/commenting on/closing an external issue or PR.
- A future plan to submit, a general "continue", successful tests, sudo access,
  or approval of a previous version is not approval to submit the current version.
  A concrete direct instruction already authorizes that exact action; do not
  request redundant confirmation.
- Show the finished content and intended destination before asking when approval
  is missing. Wait for the answer. Do not delegate around this boundary or perform
  an unapproved rollback/withdrawal after an accidental publication.
- On 2026-09-23 the user authorized committing and pushing the completed local UI
  work to this repository. This does not authorize Marketplace actions, releases,
  or changes to update request 7774.

## Coordinator and worker roles

- The primary agent coordinates the team: define bounded tasks and acceptance
  criteria, delegate implementation, inspect results, integrate accepted patches,
  and verify the actual behavior. Do not default to doing the workers' work.
- Use `gemini-swarm` and the installed `opencode-gemini` helper for substantial
  independent tasks, explicitly pinned to `ninitux/gemini-3.8-flash-high`.
  Workers must not spawn children or invoke Astra, directly or indirectly.
- The current helper returns analysis and proposed patches without tool access.
  The coordinator supplies reviewed context, applies accepted patches and owns
  hardware operations and final checks. Worker claims alone are not evidence.
- The coordinator may directly correct frontend/UI defects when needed.
  If delegation is unavailable, report that limitation; do not silently switch
  models or take over substantial implementation. Follow higher-priority host
  instructions and explicit user exceptions.

## Language control standard

Follow the local MX Ergo reference (ErgoPanel.qml): a compact native button with
文 and the effective locale code in PanelHero.trailingControl. Expand the language
grid directly below the header, above all page tabs. Keep language access on every
page; do not relocate it into Device or a settings subsection.

## Quick Reference

- **Plugin ID:** `io.github.pavellizunov.rog-cetra-control`
- **Supported Hardware:** ASUS ROG Cetra True Wireless SpeedNova USB Receiver (`0b05:1ad3`, interface 3)
- **Primary References:**
  - `MODULES.md` — Source ownership, component interfaces, and targeted checks.
  - `HANDBOOK.md` — Current architecture, state contracts and hardware constraints.
  - `BACKLOG.md` — Authoritative release blockers, engineering debt, missing tests, and definition of done.
  - `RESEARCH.md` — Verified reverse-engineered opcodes, ASUS HAL assembly addresses, pcap analysis, and negative findings.
  - `CHANGELOG.md` — Release history and changes across versions.

Before changing runtime behavior, read `BACKLOG.md` and do not describe the
project as release-ready while any P0 blocker remains open.

Private C modules live in `daemon/` and compile through the single owner entry
point. QML section components receive the view model explicitly. Read MODULES.md
before editing; preserve tests of the complete implementation after moving code.
Historical records in `docs/archive/` and dated reviews are evidence, not current
instructions. New development procedures are written in English.

## Non-Negotiable Safety Rules

1. **Never Fuzz HID Opcodes:**
   - Do not send randomized or arbitrary HID reports to the receiver or earbuds.
   - Only send commands with verified semantics documented in `RESEARCH.md` and `HANDBOOK.md`.

2. **No Second Hidraw Reader:**
   - All USB HID communication belongs exclusively in the single long-running `cetra-watch` owner.
   - Multiple `hidraw` readers race for asynchronous interrupt reports and corrupt device state.
   - Other monitors or processes must connect via the UNIX socket (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/rog-cetra-control.sock`).

3. **Microphone Mute Integrity:**
   - Never inject synthetic software microphone mute/unmute commands (e.g. `05 33` or ALSA muting) disguised as native hardware mute.
   - The headset's internal mute state is hardware-controlled by the physical earbud touch sensor and announced by the native voice prompt (*"Microphone off/on"*).
   - In-call right earbud single-tap reports (`cc 70 .. 01 01`) are gesture edges, identical for both mute directions, not absolute state. Reports can be missed; `tap_seq` counts observed reports only and must never drive a Live/Muted inference.
   - Keep microphone state `Unknown` (`microphone_state: "unknown"` in the corrected daemon contract) until a reproducible absolute hardware readback exists. Do not restore `mic_live`, manual `mic_state` resync, or a Live reset on reconnect. The plugin does not decode the voice prompt, and PCM silence is not proof of native mute. See `BACKLOG.md` P0.1 for pending implementation verification.

4. **Omarchy Lockscreen Guard (Upstream Bug #9441):**
   - Never replace binary helpers in `bin/` while `omarchy-shell lock status` indicates the screen is locked or requested.
   - Hot-reloading plugins during screen lock causes a Quickshell session lock crash in Omarchy Quattro.

5. **Omarchy Plugin Guidelines Compliance:**
   - No symlinks anywhere in the repository.
   - Zero hardcoded displayed UI hex colors in QML. SVG source masks may use white (`#fff`/`#ffffff`) and must be recolored with `Color.*`, `bar.*`, or `Style.*` at runtime. Device RGB previews are data, not decorative theme colors.
   - Strict adherence to manifest schema v1 and standard `bar-widget` lifecycle.

## Mandatory Verification Protocol

Before declaring any change complete or committing:

```bash
./tests/run.sh
omarchy plugin validate .
git diff --check
```

For runtime changes, also verify:
1. Exactly one `cetra-watch` process owns the receiver: `pgrep -a cetra-watch`.
2. Status cache is valid JSON: `cat "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-/tmp}/rog-cetra-control.status"`.
3. Telemetry logging continues properly: `tail -n 10 ~/.local/state/omarchy/rog-cetra-control.log`.
